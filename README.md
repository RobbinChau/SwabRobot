Project Abstract: In today's world where the prevention and control of new crown outbreaks are under control, testing patients after throat swab collection is still the main means of upper respiratory virus detection. Traditional throat swab collection mostly requires healthcare workers to face the patient directly, which is not only inefficient, but also increases the risk of infection for healthcare workers. The pharyngeal swab collection robot, orientated to the needs of intelligent large-scale collection, can achieve remote automatic collection operation and reduce the risk of doctor-patient cross. It can not only protect the sampling personnel, but also carry out efficient pharyngeal swab collection, and the robot has a unified sampling specification to increase the accuracy of sampling.
The goal of this project: to achieve the function of automatic pharyngeal swab collection by robotic arm, firstly, to understand the significance of the subject research and the current situation of pharyngeal swab robots; then to learn the hardware platform including robotic arm, industrial camera, flexible pressure sensors, etc.; then to learn the theoretical knowledge of the coordinate system transformation of the robotic arm, target detection, digital filtering, etc.; and finally to develop the overall program using the languages of Python and URScript and debugging. The experimental results show that this system can effectively achieve the automatic and safe pharyngeal swab collection function, which demonstrates the great potential brought by the integration and innovation of robotics in the medical field.
The project was completed in June 2023, and participated in the 25th China Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Competition Jiangsu Regional Finals and the 2023 College Students' Information Technology Application Competition and Artificial Intelligence Competition and won the awards.
