Project Abstract: In today's world where the prevention and control of new crown outbreaks are under control, testing patients after throat swab collection is still the main means of upper respiratory virus detection. Traditional throat swab collection mostly requires healthcare workers to face the patient directly, which is not only inefficient, but also increases the risk of infection for healthcare workers. The pharyngeal swab collection robot, orientated to the needs of intelligent large-scale collection, can achieve remote automatic collection operation and reduce the risk of doctor-patient cross. It can not only protect the sampling personnel, but also carry out efficient pharyngeal swab collection, and the robot has a unified sampling specification to increase the accuracy of sampling.
The goal of this project: to achieve the function of automatic pharyngeal swab collection by robotic arm, firstly, to understand the significance of the subject research and the current situation of pharyngeal swab robots; then to learn the hardware platform including robotic arm, industrial camera, flexible pressure sensors, etc.; then to learn the theoretical knowledge of the coordinate system transformation of the robotic arm, target detection, digital filtering, etc.; and finally to develop the overall program using the languages of Python and URScript and debugging. The experimental results show that this system can effectively achieve the automatic and safe pharyngeal swab collection function, which demonstrates the great potential brought by the integration and innovation of robotics in the medical field.
The project was completed in June 2023 and participated in the 25th China Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Competition.

项目摘要：在新冠疫情防控得到控制的今天，对患者进行咽拭子采集后进行检测仍然是上呼吸道病毒检测的主要手段。传统的咽拭子采集大多需要医护人员直面患者，不仅效率低，也增大了医护人员的感染风险。咽拭子采集机器人，面向智能化大规模采集的需求，可以实现远程自动采集操作，降低医患交叉风险。不仅可以保护采样人员，也能进行高效的咽拭子采集，并且机器人具有统一采样规范，增加采样的准确性。
本项目的目标：实现机械臂自动采集咽拭子的功能，首先了解咽拭子机器人的课题研究意义与现状；然后学习包括机械臂、工业相机、柔性压力传感器等在内的硬件平台；接着学习机械臂坐标系变换、目标检测、数字滤波等理论知识；最后使用Python和URScript语言开发整体程序并调试。实验结果表明本系统能有效地实现自动且安全的咽拭子采集功能，展现了机器人技术在医疗领域融合创新带来的巨大潜力。
该项目完成于2023年6月，参加了第 25 届中国机器人及人工智能大赛
江苏赛区总决赛以及2023年大学生信息技术应用能力比赛暨人工智能大赛并获奖。
